Hello,

for Alexa integration just make it with this excellent introductions.

instead of the NodeRED_flows.txt you use Blume_NodeRed_import.txt for import... 
and push implement.

Then it should work...

If  not, let me know.

ATTENTION: got problems by using names like "rainbow twinkle" "rainbow" cause alexa recognizes "rainbow" twice. You have to use names only once. maybe like "rainbow" and "twinklebow" "glitterbow"  or something like that
