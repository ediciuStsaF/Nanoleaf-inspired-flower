Hello,

for Alexa integration just make it with this excellent introductions: https://github.com/NimmLor/esp8266-nanoleaf-webserver

instead of the NodeRED_flows.txt you use Blume_NodeRed_import.txt for import... 
and push implement.

 
The Flower: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3497678

In my case (in the software) the Flower is built with 3 Leds per Leaf and 5 leafs for the strunk ( 2 Leaves + 3 straight parts )
for more instructions look at NimmLorÂ´s projekt.
The actual version is the version of February 2019 and it should also work with Alexa...
instead of the NodeRED_flows.txt you use Blume_NodeRed_import.txt for import and push implement.

Then it should work...

If  not, let me know.

ATTENTION: got problems by using names like "rainbow twinkle" "rainbow" cause alexa recognizes "rainbow" twice. You have to use names only once. maybe like "rainbow" and "twinklebow" "glitterbow"  or something like that
